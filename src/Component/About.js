      <p className="mb-4">
        Hey there! I'm <strong>Ritik Rastogi</strong>, a final-year B.Tech CSE student (graduating in 2025) and a passionate <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>. 
        This NewsAPI web application was created as a collaborative project with my talented peers â€” <strong>Manish</strong>, <strong>Prem</strong>, and <strong>Ashish Kumar</strong> â€” all of us driven by a shared love for coding, creativity, and solving real-world challenges through technology.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We developed this platform to deliver fast, clean, and up-to-date news from reliable sources using modern web technologies like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, and <strong>REST APIs</strong>. Our focus was not just on functionality, but also on performance, user experience, and scalability.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This project reflects our commitment to continuous learning and growth as aspiring developers. Itâ€™s more than just a college project â€” itâ€™s a step toward building impactful digital solutions.
      </p>
